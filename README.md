# Hack110
Created a 2D game in 24 hours during the 2019 Hack 110 hackathon. 
The goal of the game was to avoid an enemy for as long as possible while random obstacles appeared around you. 
If you survived for a certain amount of time then you survived the round. If the enemy caught you three times then it was game over.

This game was created using Javascript and the pixi.js library.
